# LandingPage-OpalVisions


This is a concept landing page for a fictional audiovisual and high-tech agency.

I used Jquery library for the hamburger responsive menu.

I got the letters animation on the hero section from Greensock library.

The "reveal on scroll" effect is pure CSS keyframes animation but is set on scrolling by a JS function.

I get the design inspiration from some awwwards and maxibestof-one websites.
Especially "opal camera" and "madebystudio family" where i find the themes, the logo and many images.

I used the "Syne" google font to stick to "Aktiv grotesk" font aesthetics trend.
